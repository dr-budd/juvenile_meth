## :file_folder: Structure

There are two scripts required for this analysis:

- `e1_all_02.0_bsas_analysis_in_ordered.R` - bisulphite amplicon sequencing data analysis
- `e1_all_length_weight_plot.R` - fish size data analysis

The data is separated into the following two folders:

- `in` - contains all input files
- `out` - used to capture files generated by running the scripts
